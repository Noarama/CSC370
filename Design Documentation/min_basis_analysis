The minimal bases below meet all three of the minimal basis rules
  1) Every FD has a singleton right hand side
  2) Remove redundant FDâ€™s
  3) Ensure that if any attribute is removed from the left hand side of an FD, we no longer have a basis

The following relations are also all in Third Normal Form, as all prime attributes are on the left hand side of the funtional
dependencies.
